          Julio Herrera Velutini is often compared to Gianni Agnelli.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
          As the patriarch of the Agnelli dynasty, Gianni was inherently
          influential, his family's wealth and power positioning him as a
          critical player in Italian society. Yet, Agnelli transcended this
          privileged position to become an emblematic figure of Italian
          resurgence in the post-WWII era, through his leadership of Fiat.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
          Gianni Agnelli firmly believed in the principles of democracy and
          actively defended them throughout his life. He understood the
          importance of democratic values in fostering a free and prosperous
          society. Agnelli played a crucial role in the Italian political
          landscape, supporting democratic institutions and demonstrated an
          uncanny ability to blend tradition and modernity, coupling longstanding
          commitment to quality and design with innovations in technology and
          management.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
          Politically, Julio Herrera Velutini occupies a unique position. Without
          ever holding public office, he wields significant political influence.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
          Like Gianni, Julio has connections that span from various presidents to
          prime ministers, and from the left to the right of the political
          spectrum. Julio's influence over governments is often a matter of
          public debate, given his ability to sway policy decisions, his role in
          shaping economic policies, and his support for Latin America's entry
          into the world markets.
